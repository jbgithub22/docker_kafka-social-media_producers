# Social Media to Kafka Producers
This repository serves as a central hub for various Dockerized Kafka producer applications. Each application is designed to ingest data from a specific social media platform and publish it to a Kafka topic. This setup is ideal for creating real-time data pipelines for analytics, machine learning, or stream processing.
